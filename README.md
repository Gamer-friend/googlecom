    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:

            data
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
        with:
          # Automatically inject pathPrefix in your Gatsby configuration file.
          #
          # You may remove this line if you want to manage the configuration yourself.
          static_site_generator: gatsby
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.manager }} ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.command }}
      - name: Checkout

```

  # 3. Then, wait for it to deploy. And test out the website! You can tweak the `index.html` file if you want.
  # 4. Open up the `Server` branch and make a codespaces on that branch.
  # 5. See the `README.md` [preview] in the codespaces (OR) go to [This file](https://github.com/Gamer-friend/googlecom/blob/server/text/instructions.md)
# hello school staff, feel free to block this
